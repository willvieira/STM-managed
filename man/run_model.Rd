\title{Run the model over time}
\usage{
run_model(steps, initLand, managInt = c(0, 0, 0, 0), RCP = 0,
  stoch = TRUE, cores = 1, outputLand = NA, rangeLimitOccup = NULL,
  stateOccup = FALSE, saveOutput = FALSE, fileOutput = NULL,
  folderOutput = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{steps}{numeric, the total number of steps to run the model. Here 1 step is equivalent to 5 years.}

\item{initLand}{output object from the \code{\link{create_landscape}} function}

\item{managInt}{vector, intensity of the four ordered management practices: plantation, harvest, thinning and enrichment plantation. Values must be bounded between \code{0} and \code{1}, where \code{0} means the natural dynamics without forest management.}

\item{RCP}{Numeric, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway}{Representative Concentration Pathway}. Five scenarios of RCP are available: \code{0}, \code{2.6}, \code{4.5}, \code{6} and \code{8.5}}

\item{stoch}{logical, if \code{TRUE}, the prevalence of each cell will depend in a probabilistic random generator. Otherwise the prevalence will be deterministic.}

\item{cores}{numeric,  the number of cores to be used in a parallel computation. The parallel is computed with the \code{mclapply} function. If \code{cores = 1}, a loop for will be used instead.}

\item{outputLand}{vector, an integer vector to define the time steps to be saved at the end of the simulation. This argument is useful when we only need to compare the first and last time step \code{outputLand = c(1, steps)}, or when the size of the landscape is too big so we can reduce memory usage.}

\item{rangeLimitOccup}{numeric between 0 and 1. If \code{rangeLimitOccup} is not \code{NULL}, the function will calculate the south range limit of Boreal state and the north range limit of Temperate state of each time step. The defined value determines the minimum occupancy a row of the landscape must be occupied by a specific forest state to be considered part of the state range. It returns a data frame.}

\item{stateOccup}{logical, calculate state proportion for each row of the landscape for all time steps. Returns a list with a data frame for each time step}

\item{saveOutput}{logical, if \code{TRUE} it will save the output list in the 'output' directory with an automatic name with the main information from the simulation}

\item{fileOutput, }{character, if not \code{NULL}, define the name of the file output}

\item{folderOutput, }{character, if not \code{NULL}, define the name of the folder other than the default 'output'}
}
\value{
a list with the (i) landscape configuration for each step, (ii) scaled temperature gradient, (iii) steps, (iv) management intensity, (v) RCP scenario, (vi) landscape dimensions and (vii) range limit data frame
}
\description{
This function generates the spatiotemporal dynamics based in the initial landscape, climate change and forest management
}
\examples{
initLand = create_landscape(cellSize = 5)

lands <- run_model(steps = 10, initLand,
                   managInt = c(0.15, 0, 0, 0),
                   RCP = 4.5,
                   rangeLimitOccup = 0.75)
